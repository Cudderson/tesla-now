<h1>What is a Candlestick Chart?</h1>
<br>
<h3>Candlestick Charts use 'OHLC' prices (open, high, low, close) to create 'candles' for a certain time interval,
typically 1 day per candle.</h3>
<br>
<h3>Candlestick charts are a staple for investors, as they provide detailed insight to how the market is trending
for a particular company, many companies, or the entire stock market.</h3>
